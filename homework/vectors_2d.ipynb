    "What is a vector? This question must first be understood in order to proceed with the homework. A vector is something like an object that has a magnitude or amount of something and a direction. The coordinate system helps us visuals vectors. A vector in two dimensions can have a direction on both the x and y coordinate plane as opposed to a one dimensional vector that would only be + or - on one axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Considering that a 2D vector can be visualy depicted on an x and y plane using the coordinate system, then we know each vector has two components to its direction (x,y). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Knowing that a 2D vector has two components, an x and a y, we can estimate the length of these x,y componets based on a given vector like the ones in the following exercise.\n",
